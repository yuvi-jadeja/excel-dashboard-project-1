Enhancing Sales Performance for a Women's Clothing Brand: An Excel Dashboard Analysis
In this project, I developed an interactive Excel dashboard to analyse sales data for an online store specializing in women's clothing. The dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of key performance metrics, including sales trends, customer demographics, product performance, and seasonal variations.

Through detailed data visualization and analysis, I identified actionable insights and strategic recommendations to boost sales performance. Key insights include identifying top-selling products, understanding customer purchasing behaviour, and recognizing seasonal trends to optimize inventory and marketing strategies.

This project demonstrates my ability to leverage Excel's powerful data analysis tools to drive business growth and improve decision-making processes.

Tools Used: Excel
